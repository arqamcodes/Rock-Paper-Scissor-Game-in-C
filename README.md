# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game-in-C
Developed a Rock, Paper, Scissors game in C language, spicing it up with a while loop, if-else statements, and the random module. This engaging game allows players to face off against the computer. By incorporating a while loop, the game keeps running until the player decides to quit, providing an interactive and continuous gaming experience.

The core of the game lies in the if-else statements, which determine the winner based on the player's choice and the randomly generated computer choice. The random module adds an element of unpredictability to the computer's selections, making each round exciting and challenging.
